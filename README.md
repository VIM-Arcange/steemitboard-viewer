# steemitboard-viewer

View user's related steemitboard.com page from any steemit.com user's page, post or comment

When you are on https://steemit.com and the URL contains any valid @username, this extension allows you to quickly jump to the board of the user.

E.g. if you are viewing the page https://steemit.com/@arcange, you will see the SteemitBoard icon enlighted. Clicking on it will take you to my board at http://steemitboard.com/@arcange

If you appreciate my work, you can vote for me as delegate on https://steemit.com/~witnesses
